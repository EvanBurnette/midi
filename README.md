# MIDI CC library

This is the MIDI CC library maintained by User Camp. We want to document the MIDI implementation of every synthesizer.

Among other things, it powers Condukt's built-in device definitions. Condukt is a performance MIDI controller for iPad. You can [sign up for Condukt's development newsletter](https://eepurl.com/gtKfp1), or [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/goodcondukt).
